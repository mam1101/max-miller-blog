    <div>
    <p>
        Max Miller is a writer and software engineer from southern New Hampshire. After graduating from the University of New Hampshire with a BS in physics, he moved to Boston where he now resides with his partner and their zero cats, zero dogs, and many plants. When he isn’t twiddling away writing or programming, he can be found running, reading, buying notebooks, and devouring coffee.
