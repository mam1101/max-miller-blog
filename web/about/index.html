    Max Miller is an engineer, hiker, cryptid-enthusiest, and writer. 
    Growing up in southern New Hampshire, Max's love of the outdoors and 
    the horrors that may-or-may-not be lurking in the New England wilderness 
    drove a passion for crafting stories that lurk under the surface of the innocuous. 
    After graduating with a Bachelors of Science in Physics from the University 
    of New Hampshire, Max moved to Brookline MA where he now resides and works as 
    a software engineer. Most days he can be seen skulking around his local coffee 
    shop or bookstore, usually with a notebook and pen. On the weekends, he likes 
    hiking with his friends in the White Mountains and visiting local Massachusetts 
    nature trails. His work can be found in *Wingless Dreamer*, UNH's *Aegis*, 
    and on his personal blog *A Chair in the Void*.
