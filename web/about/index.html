  <p>Max Miller is an engineer, hiker, cryptid-enthusiest, and writer. Growing up in southern New Hampshire, Max's love of the outdoors and the horrors that may-or-may-not be lurking in the New England wilderness drove a passion for crafting stories that lurk under the surface of the innocuous. After graduating with a Bachelors of Science in Physics from the University of New Hampshire, Max moved to Brookline, MA where he now resides and works as a software engineer. Most days he can be seen skulking around his local coffee shop and bookstore, usually with a notebook and pen. On the weekends, he likes hiking in the White Mountains with his friends and visiting local Massachusetts nature trails.</p>
