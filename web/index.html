        Max Miller is an engineer, hiker, cryptid-enthusiest, and writer. 
        Growing up in southern New Hampshire, Max's love of the outdoors and 
        the horrors that may-or-may-not be lurking in the New England wilderness 
        drove a passion for crafting stories that lurk under the surface of the innocuous. 
        After graduating with a Bachelors of Science in Physics from the University 
        of New Hampshire, Max moved to Brookline MA where he now resides and works as 
        a software engineer. Most days he can be seen skulking around his local coffee 
        shop or bookstore, usually with a notebook and pen. On the weekends, he likes 
        hiking with his friends in the White Mountains and visiting local Massachusetts 
        nature trails. His work can be found in <a href="https://winglessdreamer.com/">Wingless Dreamer</a>, 
        UNH's <a href="https://wildcatlink.unh.edu/organization/aegis">Aegis</a>, 
        and on his personal blog <a href="https://medium.com/a-chair-in-the-void">A Chair in the Void</a>.
