<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>In as much as human psychology can be an exact science, the practice must be called a practice in insanity, because for all the rational contained inside the human mind, the presence of imagination calls into question everything we do, have, or will ever know. The dreamer, the waking and the sleeping, only ever serves to muddy the waters of understanding. Human, with the full weight of their logic and ration behind them, is not a human at all but an automaton husk hidden behind the thin veneer of skin and internal organs walking and breathing the same as the imaginative human, yet without the mechanisms to recognize it as such. So why then do humans pursue the rational if its complete presence leads us away from that which separates us from the lifeless? A curse, perhaps, an old one, that requires rational to be the only tool to cure humans of the one thing they fear most: Dread for the unknown.</i></span></p>

<h1>Prologue</h1>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sun filters through the tall pine canopy. Hard rays of golden light cast down on the early autumn forest. The six-inch gash on Erich’s thigh bleeds profusely. He is a giant in any human crowd, but in the forest of ancient trees, he is as insignificant as the rodents that scurry beneath the beds of yellow needles. With every breath, the sweet air burns his haggard lungs. He’s been running, or rather quickly limping, for unknown hours through the endless, dense pine forest. Progress feels scant in this repeating sea of trees. Though he has a map, it is useless here. Erich fears his body will give out before he reaches solace. More, he fears he will die before he can catalogue his observations. He spent years tracking the whelp. To leave it unobserved in the scientific literature would be untenable.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He reaches into the large, worn leather satchel at his hip and removes his balled fist. He unfurls his fingers to consult his compass, the glass housing cracked and fogged. Northeast, moving towards the mountains. Or maybe he’s in the mountains now, and that brief stretch of burning lungs was the trek up. The trees do not give purview outside their domain. They obscure the features of the terrain. He cannot see the horizon. The position of the sun tells him it is noontime. He chuckles briefly to himself, the momentary elation causing a jolt of pain from his chest. He hasn’t seen a clock in days. What does time matter now?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He looks behind. A breeze rattles the evergreen needles. A branch above groans. The pines settle. Black spots enter his eyesight. He stumbles. He can’t stop, not yet. Maybe a brief pause, just enough to regain a modicum of energy. He continues on. There is no stopping.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He knows, despite his lifetime of trying to avoid it, that this was how all of his ilk dies: bloodied, defeated, running at the end of their life. Those who bear the burden of his blood rarely died peacefully in their sleep; this is how his father died, how his brother died, and, though her body was never found, certainly how his sister died. He abhors this birthright, as he does all the birthrights of his family. Even as he runs from it, he cannot disassociate from the danger beset by his line of work. He may not hunt, but that does not preclude from being the hunted. That is the danger of the Manifold, of studying that which has been hunted for all of history. Old ties are hard to break; fighting is easier than learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pine forests come from another reality. Underbrush is not permitted to grow, shrouded from nutrient light by the imposing pines and their thick-weaved needle blanket. To walk through a pine forest is to walk through a place so encompassed by a single living organism, so overtaken by its might, that the land must bow to its splendor. The pines take and the pines give. Perhaps the preternatural are drawn to the pines for this reason: they see in the trees the same Manifold energy wanting to draw out the surrounding universe, manipulate their space, craft a world in themselves. The pine forests of the Pacific Northwest know of this behavior.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Erich stops at the base of a large fir, resting his hand on the trunk and allowing his lungs a moment of respite. He coughs, spitting up thin flecks of blood. The sweet air sickens him. He wishes for a bed, for a warm bath, for anything to rid himself of the stink and fluids—most, not all, his own—that mat down the cracked hair of his legs and chest. His clothes reek, his bare skin stings. More pertinent, pulsating and never far from his mind, is the gash. If he doesn’t find rest soon, it will certainly bleed him out. He reapplies pressure to his leg. His vision blurs beyond the point of use. How quaint. How uneventful. The blaze of glory had been earlier, and now he is a lame doe set to die away from the fight. Good. He’d rather not give credence to his name. Let him die without a fight. Not quite peace, but at least without a knife or gun in his hand.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It may be that the forest listened to the reluctant Jäger as he dragged along on his final good breaths. Pine forests rarely listen to anyone—they are for themselves, that is. So the Jäger, so weary and so tired, reserved himself to die in this place. That is a cool realization to come to: at once you will be alive and then you will be a spirit on track for the Manifold beyond. This is why he laughs while blood and tears mix on the pallet of his face. The forest listens to this laughter and feels his blood and tastes his tears as they seep into the soil and roots. The trees take pity on him. Branches part. The Jäger looks forward. The pines guide him through the winding paths until a terminus in a clearing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A cabin: small, cold, and desolate, with the rusted detritus of a long-abandoned lumber camp asunder. He limps, laughing so hard now as to rattle the branches that guide him here. He enters. The rancid stink of decaying flesh floods his nostrils. Had his stomach any capacity for it, he would throw up. Dry heaves come instead. He falls to the hard floor in a lumpy mass of human muscle and Jäger blood. An elderly, spindly man with sunken eyes and papery white skin stands over a counter, pieces of sinew and meat covering a wooden outcropping. Red splotches stain his naked frame, like the skin itself has absorbed the blood of the many dead things before him. A cleaver bows the untreated wood. There are no flies here.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The old man speaks to him, lips unmoving: “<i>You aren’t meant to be here yet. Go to the inn. I will see you soon.</i>”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The old man smiles. Erich nods. He is not afraid. This is normal, as part of the trade as the gash in his side. A final pang of laughter exits his lungs before his vision goes black.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Erich awakes to an open road. His legs ache. The sun points at a 35 degree angle, dispersing long shadows to the street lamps and coniferous trees that replaced the pines. Behind him is the pine forest, darkened from the retreating sun. The cabin is not here, and his memory of the place is cold and disjointed. The firmness of the paved sidewalk is foreign to his feet, yet he hobbles onto it like an astronaut kissing fresh soil. He is haggard, weighed down by blood and days of sweat and dirt. Several kind-looking people, lacking any notion of noteworthiness, walk two-and-two down the sidewalk. They converse, paying no mind to Erich. A perceptive man in a light colored Patagonia upturns his nose, but, if asked, he would mumble a canned phrase about insufficient garbage collection or lack of roadkill removal infrastructure—two points he undoubtably voted <i>against</i> in the last municipal election. Children no older than twelve rush by on bikes, shouting at each other and sending queer gazes to Erich before quickly looking away as though they hadn’t seen him at all. One of them shouts, “Hey, watch it, shithead!” as their bike veers off the sidewalk onto the street, which is paved straight and with no evidence of having been driven on by a car. The children laugh, shouting expletives at each other with abandon, much to the chagrin of the eldest of the adults bounding along in their wake.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Erich takes a long, single breath in. The flow is unlabored. The air is not so sickly sweet here. Rather, it is dry. He is cold, but pleasantly so. He down looks at his leg. The bleeding has stopped, though the pain and weariness remain. He is weak. He looks up. Halfway hidden by a fir branch is a green government sign reading:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Green Springs, OR. Population 2,156.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A faint, implacable memory comes to him: the inn. He gathers himself, checking for his bag and patting his legs, as if to tell himself that yes, indeed, he is corporeal. He sets off down the road. After so many hours amongst the liminal sea of pines, Erich is lost in the realism of the small town. The pain emanating from his injuries has distracted him from a mounting headache, but now, with the momentary relaxation of Green Spring, a red band presses above his orbitals. He sees a sign for <i>The Redwood Inn</i> amongst a green-brown collection of tourist signs. One points to <i>The Piquancy Potion</i>, another to the <i>Inner Klamath Range Hiking Trail</i>, and a third to a place 0.1 miles away called <i>The Street Car</i>.<i> </i>He orients himself with the inn, listed as 0.3 mi from the post. Several cyclists pass by, unperturbed by Erich’s presence. The last gift of the pine’s, though it is fading quickly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Green Springs proper is compact. He finds the inn is not far from the center road, down a small secluded stretch shielded from the downtown by a squall of massive trees. The six-story gothic building would dwarf in any other location. A small garden with a winding cobblestone walkway precedes the inn. Well-trimmed hedges and white roses snake along the way. Several grape vines crawl around stone benches and up wood cages acting as botanical jungle gyms. Around, robins and jays perch and peck. A pair of ravens jump between the high branches of the redwoods. An older man in a newsy hat and slacks sits on a bench. He reaches into his hand and makes a throwing motion out toward the grass in front of him. The ravens watch him, heads cocked. He moved his head mechanically to observe Erich come down the cobble walkway. His smiles shines a thin shade of silver. His voice is distant, like it’s coming from a tunnel several yards from where he sits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Sir,” the man says to Erich. “Are you okay? You look fairly worse for wear. Come, sit, feed the birds with me. It’ll do you well.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Had he his wits, this trick would’ve been apparent to Erich. But he sees before him a man, as any man, without incident. The tone of his voice, nor the sheen of his smile now crawling around his entire frame, indicate anything untoward. Erich hasn’t spoken in weeks. His words come out harsh, “Hiking accident.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Erich walks past the man to the large redwood double doors. He grabs the wrought iron door handle for support, pulling down with his full two-hundred-seventy pounds of body weight. The door doesn’t balk. This momentary respite brings him a brief wit, and he turns back to address the man. The bench is empty. Erich nods. He used up the last of his laughter in the forest. He struggles to keep a grip on the door. Several steps more and he’ll be okay. This place is safe. He knows it’s safe; he doesn’t know why he knows it is safe. It has to be safe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He pulls. The door opens in excruciating sequence. Erich stumbles in, relief coursing through him.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The inn lobby is sparsely populated. An older woman walks in the adjoining hall. A man in a woman, appearing as dirty but more emaciated than Erich, sit before an ornate brick fireplace with a deck of cards between them. A tall man with dark skin and a white suit stands behind the counter with a prim posture, tapping the butt of a pen over a large notebook. Erich approaches the counter as calmly as he can, dragging his leg behind him. He places his bag on the counter, reaches a hand in, and drags out several dollars, coins, euros, and scraps of paper on to the counter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“A room,” he says. “For one week.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The concierge, barely an eyebrow cocked, takes several of the American bills.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“That’s just a week, you said?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I can pay more if I need more time. For now, a week.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Alright.” The concierge flattens the bills, then counts them like he’s hitting a speed bag. “We usually ask for a card on file. It’s a <i>new</i> policy.” He groans, notes something in his large ledger, reaches behind him, and removes a heavy iron key from the board. “I’ll hang onto all <i>this</i>, and we’ll consider you <i>on file</i>. Welcome to The Redwood Inn, sir. We hope you enjoy your stay in our historic hotel. We serve breakfast every morning in the lobby. Dinner is ad hoc, on request. We have a kitchen in back and—”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Erich drags the key off the counter, the metal clanging loudly. He nods. The concierge takes the hint. Erich reads the attached wooden fab: <i>Room 317</i>. He turns, looks at the elevator, and sighs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Sir,” the concierge says. “If you need anything at all, call the front desk. We’re here twenty-four hours.” The concierge smiles. Erich, with what may be the last of his motile ability, forms his right hand into a thumbs up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The stairs are mountainous, but he takes them anyway.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He collapses on the bed, its size and softness disgustingly luxurious. He throws his bag against the dresser, unbuckles his pants, and peels off his jeans. For a moment, he feels physical relief, then he throws up on the carpeted floor. Ends up, there was a little left in there, more than he would’ve thought. He heaves again even though his stomach is devoid of any fluid, solids, or bile. He coughs loudly until the flesh of his throat turns into a bed of coals. He presses down on his bare leg. Fresh blood flows in a thin stream through the coagulated dam of his gash.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The shower steams. Erich grabs a towel and bites down hard. He steps in, the hot water at once liberating and excruciating. He screams all the screams he couldn’t in his travels. Ghastly pink water flows down his leg into the drain. He laps up the water coming off the head. He stays beneath the water until the pain subsides into the dullest it will be. This moment is a real reprieve — a moment reserved.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He might not die here in this little town. Not now, at least. After the blood and grime has washed down the drain, Erich towels himself off. He covers his wound with gauze and salve from his bag and lays nude on the bed. He barely fits. At six-foot-six-inches tall, he does not fit on most beds. He takes a small vial from his bag and down the contents. He lays his head on the pillow and closes his eyes. A day’s sleep and he will be better. That’s the curse and the boon. His father’s words echo in his head: <i>“A Jäger can recover from anything but death.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As he lies still, an image returns to him. It is a foul, retching image. An image of interest and of horror. He turns over and retrieves his bag, rummaging until he finds his notebook. He’s a zoologist, a physicist, a consummate scientist of the Manifold, and he cannot sleep until he has exhumed what is in his mind. With the grave bodily harm, he’d almost forgotten, but truthfully, he’d been thinking about getting his observations down on paper all the same. That is the life of a scientist; always observing, always thinking.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He opens a thick leather bound tome, pages new and old, and a charcoal pencil. He sketches what his memory allows him to hold. Features come to him in vivid detail. What he wished to capture more than the appearance of his assailant are the sounds, grand and euphoric. They were unlike any he had seen in his decades of study. His pencil flies, possessed by a deep need to catalogue the deepest facets of his memory. What he produces on the page is a terrible horror. There is little coherence to what he observed. He has seen the creature bare in a way it is never intended to be seen. Erich knows this, and the prospect of being the first to observe the creature in such a state invigorates his addled body and mind enough to finish his cataloguing. He swaps pencil for pen and continues writing from the hastily incomplete set of observations on the adjoining page. He writes until he feels the tincture take hold and his limbs numb. Before he collapses, he closes the book and bounds it with a strap.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With his last bout of strength, he checks the door locks. A silly action, he thinks, because this place is safe. Though he doesn’t know it, the pines told him as such. And it is safe. Safe for now, for the Jäger-turned-scientist to recover. Because that is what the Spring wants. But all wants, no matter how powerful, can only be abided so long.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>

<p class="p1">In the pines, a single tree is compromised. The sap bubbles and turns, the pines morph into something like a pine but not like a pine. As a whole, the pines are strong, but, as single units, they are susceptible. The pine-that-is-not-a-pine succumbs. It remains like this for a while, long after the Jäger has gone, until it has converted the Manifold energy entirely. The pine was enough of an energy source to allow the pine-that-is-not-a-pine to crumble into a black-grey mass and move to the squirrel running along its base. Plant to animal, a sequence with more complex Manifold chemistry than one would assume. The squirrel follows the tracks, the blood and footprints, uncertain why it has shifted focus from pre-winter nut gathering to bloodhound sniffing. It avoids the cabin, repelled by a keen sense of self-preservation. The squirrel does not take long to become. Squirrels, like the pines, are one in many, slightly more complex than the trees, but not as complex as its ultimate goal. The squirrel-that-is-not-a-squirrel leaves the pine forest to a desolate hiking trail carving through the town of Green Springs, Oregon. There, it finds a robin. Two sets of beady eyes meet. Fear petrifies the robin, and it is subsumed, and what was the squirrel-that-is-not-a-squirrel becomes a blubbery mass. The robin takes longer to become; birds are more complex than rodents. But in time the robin is gone, and what remains is the robin-that-is-not-a-robin. The creature flies, following a scent, to The Redwood Inn. There it perches upon the branch of one of the eponymous redwoods and waits. Two ravens watch from the opposite tree and fly off, knowing what the robin is.</p>
<p class="p1">The creature waits and watches. It knows there is power in this place, an eminent power of the Manifold. It craves all within as the hungry cougar craves the deer. And it craves the Jäger, not for food, but to even the score. The Jäger got too close. The Jäger will end the creature. This is biological defense at work—a simple science. Territoriality, well observed and documented.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The robin-that-is-not-a-robin waits. It cannot wait long or else the facade will dissolve and the creature will become a stinking, writhing mass of mucus and puss like the pine and the squirrel. But that will not come for a while, and there is so much Manifold energy in this town the creature may become.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">So many creatures abound.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">So much to consume.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
