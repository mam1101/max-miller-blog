        Max Miller is a writer and software engineer from southern New Hampshire. After graduating from the University of New Hampshire with a BS in physics, he moved to Boston where he now resides with his partner and their zero cats, zero dogs, and many plants. When he isnâ€™t twiddling away writing or programming, he can be found running, reading, buying notebooks, and devouring coffee.
