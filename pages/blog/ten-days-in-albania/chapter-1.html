<h1>Prologue</h1>

<p>A minibus rattles on the mountain pass. Distant ridge lines run for miles against a sparsely marked afternoon sky. The bus’s thirteen packed-in passengers jostle against each other on the rough roads. The majority started their journey in Korçë, like us. Farms and guest houses dart the sparse countryside. The driver grabs his flip phone from the dash, answers a call, grumbles something in Albanian, and replaces the phone in his hand with a lit cigarette. This process has repeated every ten minutes since the start of the drive. The driver cracks the window and lays his hand along the sill. Half the smoke flies out and half settles in the cabin along with the cool mountain air. The passengers all take a collective breath. We’ve been breathing in each other’s air for two hours. Any reprieve is welcomed. </p>

<p>Abby and I sit behind the driver. Like everyone else, we’re pressed shoulder to shoulder, Abby sharing her left with the bus’s window. To my right is a mother and her child, beside them an old man and his wife. Behind us is a couple several years our junior, and behind them are bags and suitcases packed as tightly as us passengers. The minibus winds through the short fertile valley and crawls back onto a crackling mountain road. Cliffs form beside us. Albania is a country of mountains, and a country of trust. </p>

<p>Abby whispers, “I’ve never seen something so beautiful.”</p>

<p>I think of the obvious retort: <em>I have</em>. But keep it to myself. I smile and lean into her. She presses her hand against the window.</p>

<p>The bus from the city of Korçë to the small mountain town of Përmet left at 1pm, information we gathered over three days by asking everyone we met in Korçë about the bus schedule. There are no timetables for the buses in Alabania, and they are the sole form of public transportation. To know when a bus leaves, one must call the bus driver — not the bus company, not a representative of the transit authority or a desk worker at the bus station — and ask them directly. Though this practice isn’t strictly required; one can stand anywhere along the route and wait for the driver to stop by, requiring one to already know the route and, likely, the bus driver. If one fails to get on a bus, they’re welcomed to try the next acceptable form of public transit: hitchhiking. We opted to be the annoying tourists and asked several people to call the bus driver for us. Snow fell piecemeal around us at the Korçë bus station. We boarded the bus labeled <em>Përmet</em> at the right place and time, shivering and stinking of second-hand cigarette smoke.</p>

<p>On the bus, I whisper, “Look at that — the clouds.” </p>

<figure>

<p>The early winter sunset casts orange on the cloud covered mountain tops. Abby smiles and takes out her phone to get a picture. She takes two snaps and closes her phone. A persistent issue of mountains and clouds is that they refuse to be photographed appropriately. They’re great at posing, but bad at smiling. We sit quietly and watch.</p>

<p>I recall two weeks earlier when I’d spoken with my grandfather about this trip. He and my grandmother traveled in their mid-twenties, though their travel was to facilitate a living working on the oil platforms off the coasts of Papua New Guinea, Borneo, and Singapore. Unlike our ten-day excursion, they expatriated for five years. For my travel, decidedly shorter and more for pleasure than his, he gave me two statements to consider. The first: as an American, foreign travel gives you an unmatched perspective; great, that’s what I wanted and expected. And the second: traveling with a partner either solidifies or ends a relationship. That gave me pause, to which he clarified, “It’ll make you two stronger.”</p>

<p>The bus driver ashes his cigarette on the lip of the open driver side window. A solid chunk of white powder flies back and hits my chest, covering my jacket in burnt tobacco. I look down at my chest. Everyone on the bus, Abby included, is in their own world. Here I am, covered in ash, while the bus driver continues on, unperturbed. I’m glad he’s focused less on where his cigarette ash went and more on not driving off the surrounding cliffs. Given the commonalty of smoking in Albania, I’m surprised it took five days for me to be the victim of an errant butt. </p>

<p>The minibus stumbles over a rocky strip. Us passengers grab anything not screwed down. The ash settles over my jacket. I tap Abby’s shoulder and gesture to my chest. She turns back and stifles a laugh. I point at the driver passively smoking his cigarette. I shake my head and smile. She brushes the ash off my chest and leans her head on my shoulder. Outside, the Albanian winter sings.</p>

<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<h2>Two Kids, Love, an Apartment, a Surgery, and Finally Going to Europe</h2>

<p>Abby and I met in July 2022. Our first date was in Boston’s North End at a small Italian cafe that serves excellent lemon basil martinis. We kissed on a bench by the water amongst a peanut gallery of Boston rats. She let me use her apartment bathroom and swiftly kicked me out, not before agreeing to a second date. By January 2023, we’d decided to move in together, and, in March of that year, we signed a lease on a three-bedroom apartment in the Boston neighborhood of Brighton with an August move in. We fell in love quickly, a love solidified through early tests and hardships. Two months into our dating, Abby — then a PhD student in evolutionary biology — went through the gauntlet of her qualifying exams. For those who don’t know any academics, these exams are the last gate a PhD student must pass through before writing their thesis. They are historically a time of emotional intensity and stress. After these exams, which she aced handily, I met her in a park by campus where she let out the bottled up stress of the last several months of studying and uncertainty. I bought her a bottle of champaign and we celebrated with take out Thai food and little plastic glasses of bubbly. Three months later, on March 15th, she was helping me and my splinted leg up the stairs of my apartment in Brookline, Massachusetts as I returned home from an ankle surgery that left me relegated to my couch for eight weeks. </p>

<p>In that time, Boston bloomed into an early spring. The bitter, snowless winter subsided, and my long recovery forced me to watch the foliage emerge from behind the panes of my second-story living room window. Once I recovered enough to crutch safely around the neighborhood, Abby would walk me like a lame dog, standing beside me with her hands out in case one of Massachusetts’s many potholes tried to take me out. During these brief outings and the many hours spent sitting inside playing cards, reading, watching movies, and ordering takeout, Abby and I conspired. What if, when all this recovery concludes and we’re moved into our new place, we go on our first big trip? We’d taken little weekend excursions before, spending three days in a small town in and around our home in New England, but we’d never hopped on a plane and gone somewhere truly foreign. For years I’d been wanting to go on <strong>The Europe Trip</strong>, the one that would change my life forever and introduce me to the wonders of the world. I’m a white guy in my mid-twenties, three years out of college, and already disenfranchised with corporate work; we’re societally predisposed to believing Europe is the arbiter of everything we’ve been missing in life. I'd traveled domestically quite a bit, and earlier that year, Abby and I ventured to the foreign land of Niagara, Ontario — my first time out of the United States. In her twenty-five years, Abby travelled liberally to Europe and Africa because of her mother's career in international non-profits and an envious inability to stay in the US for more than two months at a time. She and her parents have done various parts of the Camino de Santiago multiple times, dashed around the major European cities, and spent a month in Spoleto, Italy. In our conspiring, we came up with a steadfast requirement: we’ll go to Europe, but we’ll go somewhere Abby has never been. Europe is a big place. That left plenty of possibility.</p>

<p>Growing up in southern New Hampshire, anything north of the state capital is foreign. I’d heard tell of the French Canadians who hovered near the northern border, but until a business trip took me to Montreal, I’d never seen them in the flesh. Neither of my parents travelled internationally, the minor exception being my father, who from 4 to 8 years old lived in the aforementioned Southeast Asia countries with my grandparents, though he didn't travel internationally again until his mid-fifties. While I was in high school, I watched friends travel abroad, and, in college, this trend increased tenfold. My aunt told me how I should go; she <em>loved</em> her time abroad in France. Despite all the external hammering, I never took part. Travel was for other people. I had too much work to do at home, a career to think about, subjects to study. What a load of horseshit that was; hard work is a scam, and I spent the first seven years of my adulthood believing that I shouldn’t take the time to do what I’d always wanted, even if there was nothing stopping me. </p>

<p>In the years after college, when I grew out of this perpetual want to work myself to the bone, I learned that I love to travel. I flew around the US, taking any excuse I could to visit friends and family in New York, Miami, Denver, Portland, Pittsburgh, and San Antonio. During all this domestic travel, I held onto the grand idea of solo traveling in Europe’s great cities. I spent much of my early twenties reading the mid-century philosophers who spent their time smoking and pondering in Parisian cafes. I took the wrong message from <em>Midnight in Paris</em>, dreaming as Owen Wilson’s character does of writing novels amongst the artists and cobblestone streets of Europe. In February 2020, I even had a plan: I would take what was in my bank account and, with the three weeks between my college graduation and starting my post-graduation job, plop myself somewhere in Europe and see what happened. The trip never materialized — look up <em>spring 2020</em> if you’re not privy to why. Luckily, I saved the money and didn’t buy the tickets before the world went to shit.</p>

<p>By 2023, I was hungry to leave the US (farther than Canada, that is; love you Montreal). The original plan, as formulated by Abby, was to take a route through central Europe, starting in Budapest, passing through central Germany, and ending in Amsterdam. We would start on January 2nd, end on January 12th. That's ten days of trains and drinking espresso at little cafes, walking cobble streets and taking in the old country. Holes formed as we developed the itinerary. We spoke with Abby’s mother, who said, “It will be cold that time of year, and there’s no guarantee what the snow will do. The trains could be stuck, and you could be stuck inside.” This idealized trip was expensive. We’d saved a certain amount to make the trip happen, but we didn’t want to blow the whole thing in one go. Ideally, this would be a trip where we didn’t have to think too much about what we were spending; not in the sense that we’re just <em>so rich</em>, but cheaper options were better options; we didn’t want to quibble over if we could afford to spend a few extra dollars on dinner one night. Finally spelling death to this original idea was the timeframe: ten days was a long time, and we’d have reliable transit, but we didn’t want to spend all that time moving from place to place. There would be little room for error or unexpected pleasures. If we liked a location, we would only have a few hours — <em>maybe</em> a day — to spend there before moving on. The reality of our lives set in: this couldn't be a full, devil-may-car, no bounds trip. I had a job and Abby had her PhD to return to. This wouldn't be <strong>The Europe Trip</strong> but <em>a</em> Europe trip. More grounded than our grandest ambitions, but still spectacular.</p>

<p>We shelved the idea. Another trip for another time when we had more money and more time. I was unperturbed. I’d never been to Europe. I’ll be happy, so long as we’re on the continent. </p>

<p>Abby searched, adding the phrase <em>inexpensive</em> to her query, and came back with a surefire option: Albania. I raised an eyebrow. I’d heard of Albania. I knew it was a country in Europe, somewhere around the Balkans. I knew it to the butt of a handful of jokes on TV when I was a kid; Albanians got the same sitcom treatment as Ukrainians and Slavs. My perception of the country was otherwise uninformed. Abby showed me a map of this little country pinned opposite Italy on the Adriatic Sea, bordering Greece and North Macedonia to the east, and sharing a northern border split between Kosovo and Montenegro. She switched to the on the ground pictures: rocky cliff sides, sprawling snowcapped mountain ranges, gorgeous clear lakes, medieval villages, a modern metropolis, seaside towns, and quaint cities. Natural beauty and metropolitan splendor. The pictures matched my expectations for this trip. The first question I asked was a rookie one: is it safe? She responded quickly, “Yes, it’s very safe. One of the safest countries for tourism in Europe. And one of the cheapest.” </p>

<p>On a warm May evening, without belaboring further, we locked it in: we’re going to Albania. We hugged and started talking in broad strokes about our plans. Where would we go? Could we do it all in eight days plus travel? What do they speak in Albania? How do we get around? </p>

<hr />

<p>A quick aside to understand why Albania appealed to me on principle. Recently, I read David Foster Wallace's famous 2005 essay <a href="http://www.gourmet.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/magazine/2000s/2004/08/consider_the_lobster.html">Consider the Lobster</a>, his account of the Maine Lobster Festival for Gourmet Magazine in which he pontificates on the ravenous consumption and ritualistic mass-murder of New England’s favorite sea bug. In that piece, he includes as a footnote his thoughts on tourism, which I find appropriate to include here: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To be a mass tourist, for me, is to become a pure late-date American: alien, ignorant, greedy for something you cannot ever have, disappointed in a way you can never admit. It is to spoil, by way of sheer ontology, the very unspoiledness you are there to experience. It is to impose yourself on places that in all noneconomic ways would be better, realer, without you. It is, in lines and gridlock and transaction after transaction, to confront a dimension of yourself that is as inescapable as it is painful: As a tourist, you become economically significant but existentially loathsome, an insect on a dead thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like this quote — sue me. It succinctly sums the whole of my pessimism about travel and tourism. I dislike the subjective act of being a tourist. The idea of leaving a place of residence and becoming something else, a subjectified class, disgusts me. I have, much to my beach-loving mother's dismay, abhorred beach vacations, and my dislike for theme parks, resorts, and cruises is well known amongst those close to me. It’s the blatant commercialization of it all and the inescapable feeling of being yet another type of consumer, even in attempting to relax and have a good time, that makes tourism of any sort unappealing to me. I've come around to <em>some</em> of these activities, admittedly as a response to the overbearing nature of modern work that has me craving any elongated stretch of time where I might not be bothered by an email or Slack message. But I would be dishonest if the idea of going to Albania, a relative unknown in the vast tourism industry of Europe — in the off season no less — wasn't enhanced in part by the notion of not being one of the many in a crowd. I have the same post-modern drive for authenticity and uniqueness that compels many of my generation. I possess fanciful pretensions of blending in with the locals (inasmuch as an Anglo American of Northern European ancestry can), or at least not having them loathe me on sight because I’m <em>one of the tourists</em>. The irony of all this, as we came to learn, was that the prospect that we'd travel halfway around the world to visit their country delighted many of Albanians we met. We couldn't <em>be</em> the annoying tourists because they wouldn't <em>let</em> us. This was in part because of Albania's relative newness as an open country, the borders only opening to outsiders in the late nineties. Though generally I share Mr. Wallace's pessimism, it was unfounded for this trip. Though the craving for uniqueness remained, as did the desire for authenticity. There were definite tourist hot beds in Albania, but it’s a big country, and there’s plenty to do. </p>

<hr />

<p>We split up the responsibilities. Abby would plan the itinerary, I would handle the budget and flights. I gave Abby my single guiding principle for the itinerary: <em>I’m up for anything</em>. With her experience, this was an easy task. I bought her a Bradt guide for her birthday. We collected Reddit posts and watched travelogues. We started a shared Apple note with packing lists and requirements. She ordered one of the few English-Albanian phrase books on the market. </p>

<p>A brief aside on the Albanian language: it is unique amongst European languages. It’s the only surviving language of its language clade <em>Albanoid</em>, contains 36 letters, and resembles Romanian more than the Romance languages Abby and I studied. Upon opening the phrase book, we laughed, not at the language but at our inability to parse much of what was written. The first word, a simple <em>hello</em>, translates to <em>‌përshëndetje</em>. I don’t mean to make fun of the language because, well, I’m not an asshole. But we couldn’t stop laughing at the increasing difficulty of each phrase we tried to learn. We looked up pronunciation videos and balked at how inaccurate our phonetic approximations were. We searched for commonly spoken languages in Albania and found that if our English was no good, Spanish or Italian was our best bet.</p>

<p>“I know Spanish!” Abby said, having lived a semester in Ecuador and the Galapagos during her undergrad degree. If things got really bad, she knew a small amount of Italian from a three-week stint when she was 16, but the only workable sentence she had was <em>Gelato, please</em>. That was our contingency: anything we couldn’t parse in Albanian would go first to English, then to Spanish. And what we failed, we would cover with hand signals and Google Translate. At the very least, we memorized <em>where is the bathroom</em>, though a creative dance would’ve been just as effective.</p>

<p>There are no direct flights between Boston and Tirana. Swiss Air, Aegean Air, and Lufthansa offered the cheapest route through a deal with United. As a bonus, this route included a 21 hour layover in Zürich, Switzerland. Wonderful! We get an extra day in a country we’ve never been to, and a city that was near the top of my imagined <strong>Europe Trip</strong> itinerary. The choice was easy, and now had the bounds of our trip: eight days in Albania, two days for travel. Abby agreed, and I booked the flights. I even applied for the United Visa to get a cool $250 off our trip (I would later cancel the card, realizing United offered few interesting options out of Logan Airport). This was my first — and perhaps last — experience booking international travel for Abby and I. I bought two sets of tickets, one for me, Max Miller, and one for Abby, Abby Robinson, given name Abigail Robinson. </p>

<p><em><strong>Given name <em>Abigail</em> Robinson</strong></em>. Bold it. Underline it. Sing it atop Mt. Dajti. Never, ever forget it. I certainly won’t after what happened the day of our flight to Zürich. </p>

<p>Albania is dense with interesting locals. Over and over, we saw listed essential destinations like Tirana, Korçë, Berat (the city of a thousand windows), Durrës, and Gjirokaster; the entire stretch of Aegean coastline to the west; and the sprawling mountains of the center and east. The north was a no-go: many of the residents closed up shop and went into the southern cities during the frigid mountain winters — much like in Abby’s home state of Minnesota. Abby began to feel the same pressure as our binned central-Europe trip. Each time she came to me with a possible itinerary, I would look it over, smile, and say a form of, “I’m up for anything, man!” I knew we both valued unrestricted, semi-loose travel planning. But that last word, <em>planning</em>, and the fact that our trip was short and needfully bound by flights, meant that my attitude was more of a frustrating hinderance than a boon. To preemptively defer blame, I’ll put the onus for this on my father, whose attitude of <em>I’m up for anything, man</em> has trickled down to me. <em>Up for anything</em> is good as a guiding point, but after that, it’s an attribute of the planning, not a dogmatic creed — something I had to learn during this planning process. </p>

<p>“I need you to offer more of an opinion,” Abby said. “There’s too much to do in Albania for <em>I’m up for anything</em>.” </p>

<p>I apologized, rightfully, and we sat down and made a concerted effort to finalize the itinerary. We picked out the path that hit our most desired wants: natural beauty, quaint cities, villages, relaxation, and good food — all easy to attain in Albania. We completed the itinerary in August: <strong>Two nights in Tirana. Three nights in Korçë. Two nights in Përmet. Last night in Tirana.</strong></p>

<p>Soon after finalizing the details, we moved into our Brighton apartment (I’m writing this account from our dining room). It’s lovely, we’re happy here, and the move went as smoothly as one can in Boston: <em>okay</em> but not <em>amazing</em></p>

<p>Now, the boring stuff: Abby booked hotels, tours, and I figured out our final budget. We could finance the trip for under $2000, flights included. We determined the best place to find currency, how to pay people, what the customs were around tipping in various circumstances. We researched the weather, figured out clothes and coats. The temperature hovered around 30 F in Boston and 60 F in Tirana. I ordered a light jacket because — and this still baffles me — I didn’t <em>own</em> a light jacket. Twenty-five years in New England and somehow I’d gotten by with flannels and winter coats. I got Abby a 40L Osprey backpacking bag for Christmas. My grandmother (neé <em>Clause</em>) gifted us compression packing cubes and a bevy of Darn Tough socks. We separated our toiletries and drew straws on who carried what. Back-packing was the game, not quite in the rough but more in the spirit of packing light than heavy. We would each have one backpack and a fanny pack, nothing more. </p>

<p>“We have to be OK with being stinky,” Abby said. “We might not be able to wash our clothes.”</p>

<p>Alright. I can deal with that. I’ve never had to deal with being stinky for a long period, but I think I can do it. If anyone is going to be OK with me smelling awful, it’s the woman who sleeps next to me. I packed up the 35L Tortuga bag I’d bought in 2021 for <strong>The Europe Trip</strong> that never materialized. This was its maiden voyage. I’d waited too long for this. </p>

<p>In planning this trip, our lives went on: I recovered well from the surgery and started running and hiking again; Abby and I moved into our new apartment in Brighton, a place we loved; our best friends starting dating (and, just this year, moved into their own place down the road); and Abby and I had our first Thanksgiving and Christmas in the same geographic location. The whirlwind of holiday travel subsided. New Year came and went with fireworks and drinks. On the morning of January 2nd, 2024, Abby and I woke up in our bed in our apartment, scrubbed the whole place clean, took out the trash, and waited to leave for our 10pm flight that night. After all that planning and a year of change, we were finally doing it. In twenty-four hours, we’d be in Europe. </p>

<p>Baring, that is, the will of one United representative scrambling to fix my months-old mistake. </p>
